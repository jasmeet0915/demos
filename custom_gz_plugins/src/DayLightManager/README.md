# Day Light Managers Plugin

The Sun is the driving force behind most planetary phenomena, influencing nearly every aspect of the environment, either directly or indirectly. Accurately simulating the Sun's path is crucial for realistic environmental modeling, especially in intricate scenarios.

## Key Features

The Day Light Managers plugin for Gazebo simulates the Sun's trajectory based on the time of day and the observer's latitude.

The key factors determining the Sun's path include:
- **Time of Day**: The Sun's altitude varies throughout the day.
- **Latitude**: The observer's latitude affects the solar altitude.



## Visual Demonstration

As the Sun's altitude changes, the simulation's background color dynamically adjusts to reflect the lighting conditions.

## Usage

Users can accelerate the Sun's trajectory simulation by up to 100x and adjust the Sun's position using x and y offsets.
